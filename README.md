<h1 align = "center">🏧 ATM Simulator (Python)</h1>
<p align = "center">
  This repository contains a simple ATM Simulator program written in Python using fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input/output.
</p>

<h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  The ATM Simulator allows a user to log in with a PIN, manage their account, and perform banking operations in a controlled and interactive console environment.
</p>

<h2>🔐 Login System</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User must log in using a valid PIN.</li>
  <li>If the PIN is entered incorrectly more than three times, the system locks to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📋 Main Menu</h2>
<p>After successful login, the user is presented with the following options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check Balance</li>
  <li>Deposit Money</li>
  <li>Withdraw Money</li>
  <li>Change PIN</li>
  <li>Exit Program</li>
</ol>

<h2>💰 Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Balance Updates:</strong> Every deposit or withdrawal immediately updates the account balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Insufficient Funds Check:</strong> Withdrawals are only allowed if enough balance is available.</li>
  <li><strong>PIN Change:</strong> Users can safely update their PIN after logging in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧾 Receipt on Exit</h2>
<p>When the user exits, the system prints a summary showing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting balance</li>
  <li>Total deposited amount</li>
  <li>Total withdrawn amount</li>
  <li>Final ending balance</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 Purpose</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Practice working with Python fundamentals.</li>
  <li>Simulate a real-life banking workflow in a console application.</li>
  <li>Build structured logic using functions and conditional flows.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate user interaction and state management in a basic program.</li>
</ul>
