ATM Simulator – Overall Working Flow

    Program Start
        The program begins by initializing the required variables:
            balance is set to 0
            storedPIN is preset to 1234
            attempts counter is set to 0

    Login Phase
        The system enters a login loop to verify the user’s identity.
        The user is prompted to enter their PIN.
        The entered PIN is checked:
            If the PIN is correct, the user is granted access to the main menu.
            If the PIN is incorrect, the attempts counter increases by 1.
                If the number of failed attempts reaches 3, the system:
                    Displays an “Account Locked” message
                    Terminates the program
        If the user enters the correct PIN before running out of attempts, the program proceeds to the menu.

    Main Menu Loop
        Once logged in successfully, the user is repeatedly shown the following options:
            Check Balance
            Deposit Money
            Withdraw Money
            Change PIN
            Exit
        The user selects an option, and the system performs the appropriate action.

    Option 1 – Check Balance
        The current account balance is displayed.
        Control returns to the main menu.
